        <p>Quarto With Friends provides a way to remotely play the game Quarto with a friend. You
          share the link and then alternate turns selecting and placing pieces until a winner is declared. Quarto is a
          modern classic strategy game where you win by getting 4 in a row of the same attribute. But the twist is that
          you select the piece for your opponent to place and vice versa. To learn more about the game and to try it
          yourself, check out the demo below.</p>

        <p>Dueling with Dad Jokes is a website where players can have lighthearted fun with friends and family through
          playing a game where they face-off by telling terrible dad jokes to each other and try not to laugh. I use the
          icanhazdadjoke.com API for my joke database to provide random jokes during gameplay. I am also using this API
          in my Find Jokes feature.</p>

      <h2>More about me...</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="bio-paragraphs">
      <p>I am obsessed with finding and understanding patterns in the world around me. I always have been. The specific
        object of this obsession has varied greatly over the years - Rubik's cubes, music theory, Jungian typology,
        symbolic logic. This curiosity combined with my aptitude for solving problems led me to pursue and obtain a
        Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (with minors in Systems Engineering and Mathematics). </p>
      <p>I began my career as a Process Engineer for The J.M. Smucker Company. I loved using my analytical skills to
        continuously improve the manufacturing methods and machinery. But time and time again, I found myself drawn to
        the digital side of things. I coded new routines for the palletizing robot. I developed control logic for a
        conveyor system. I collected and analyzed machine data to analyze where our bottlenecks were. None of these
        projects were really mechanical in nature, so I thought it might be time to focus on what I was truly passionate
        about.</p>
      <p>After a break to travel, get married, and do some life reflection, I got a job as a Test Engineer with
        Issuetrak. This would be a chance for me to better assess if the software industry would be a better fit for me
        than mechanical engineering. And the answer I discovered was a resounding yes! I found myself to be a natural at
        developing and following testing procedures to help improve the quality of the software. I thrived being a part
        of the Scrum dev team, working closely with seasoned software engineers. Testing software made me hungry to
        build it myself.</p>
      <p>There wasn't a clear or quick path for me to become a developer at Issuetrak, so I decided to begin learning
        full-time. With the assistance of Thinkful, I intensely immersed myself in the world of full-stack web
        development and built the foundational technical skills required to be a good developer. </p>
      <p>Today, I am continuously expanding my skills and am eager to join a strong team of developers who also share my
        passion for pursuing excellence.</p>
