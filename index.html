        <p>Dueling with Dad Jokes is a web app which provides users a fun and lighthearted experience with friends through playing a game where they face-off by telling terrible dad jokes to each other and try not to laugh. I use the icanhazdadjoke.com API for my joke database to provide random jokes during gameplay. I am also using this API in my Find Jokes feature.</p>

      <h2>More about me...</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="bio-paragraphs">
      <p>I am obsessed with finding and understanding patterns in the world around me. I always have been. The specific object of this obsession has varied greatly over the years - Rubik's cubes, music theory, Jungian typology, symbolic logic. This curiosity combined with my aptitude for solving problems led me to pursue and obtain a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (with minors in Systems Engineering and Mathematics). </p>
      <p>I began my career as a Process Engineer for The J.M. Smucker Company. I loved using my analytical skills to continuously improve the manufacturing methods and machinery. But time and time again, I found myself drawn to the digital side of things. I coded new routines for the palletizing robot. I developed control logic for a conveyor system. I collected and analyzed machine data to analyze where our bottlenecks were. None of these projects were really mechanical in nature, so I thought it might be time to focus on what I was truly passionate about.</p>
      <p>After a break to travel, get married, and do some life reflection, I got a job as a Test Engineer with Issuetrak. This would be a chance for me to better assess if the software industry would be a better fit for me than mechanical engineering. And the answer I discovered was a resounding yes! I found myself to be a natural at developing and following testing procedures to help improve the quality of the software. I thrived being a part of the Scrum dev team, working closely with seasoned software engineers. Testing software made me hungry to build it myself.</p>
      <p>There wasn't a clear or quick path for me to become a developer at Issuetrak, so I decided to begin learning full-time. With the assistance of Thinkful, I intensely immersed myself in the world of full-stack web development and built the foundational technical skills required to be a good developer. </p>
      <p>Today, I am continuously expanding my skills and am eager to join a strong team of developers who also share my passion for pursuing excellence.</p>
